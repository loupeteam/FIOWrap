# Description
The FIOWrap library provides a simple, intuitive interface for working with files. Files offer power fail safe data storage. They have the advantage over permanent memory that they are also protected against battery failure.

The FIOWrapper provides a clean interface for the most common file operations. Any state machines necessary to perform these operations are built into the library and do not need to be implemented by the application developer.

The FIOManager provides functionality to manage disk usage by deleting old files and directories. It is very helpful for applications which log a lot of data.
